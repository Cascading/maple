# maple

A collection of useful Cascading taps.

## Building

Maple uses [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/) to build.

1. lein deps
2. lein compile
3. lein uberjar

The above should build a jar with all dependencies. 

## Usage

Maple is hosted on [Conjars](http://conjars.org/com.twitter/maple).
We expect most users will pull "com.twitter/maple" with the version they need. If you are submitting a patch, you will
need to follow the above steps in Building.
